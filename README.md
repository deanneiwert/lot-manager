### Download/Clone Repository
Either manually download this folder structure onto your system or use git to clone the repository.

### Database Configuration:
For this project to function locally, a database must be created and be accessible with a username and password.  I recommend installing [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/), creating a new database, creating a new user with a "Standard" authentication type, and providing the user with a "DBA" administrative role.
1. Create database and corresponding user credentials
2. Update the .env file with your database name and credentials:
```
DB_DATABASE=lot_manager
DB_USERNAME=admin
DB_PASSWORD=admin
```

### Install Php Libraries
import your packages, create the vendor folder, and geneate the autoload.php script.
```
composer install
```

### Install Project Dependencies:
```
npm install
```

### Database Migrations and Seeding:
In order for this step to work, the database and credentials you created must be properly configured.
